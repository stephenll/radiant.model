# radiant.model 0.9.8.7

* Improve documentation for cross-validation of `nn` and `crtree` models (i.e., `cv.nn` and `cv.crtree`)
* Fixes for breaking changes in dplyr 0.8.0
* Fix to download tables from _Model > Evaluate classificiation_
* Use an expandable `shinyAce` input for the formula and function inputs in _Model > Simulate_
* Fixes for repeated simulation with grid-search
* Use `test` instead of `validation` 

# radiant.model 0.9.8.0

* Option to add user defined function to simulations. This dramatically increases the flexibility of the simulation tool
* Ensure variable and dataset names are valid for R (i.e., no spaces or symbols), "fixing" the input as needed
* Cross validation functions for decision trees (`cv.crtree`) and neural networks(`cv.nn`) that can use various performance metrics for during evaluation e.g., `auc` or `profit`
* Option to add square and cube terms in _Model > Linear regression_ and _Model > Logistic regression_.
* Option to pass additional arguments to `shiny::runApp` when starting radiant such as the port to use. For example, radiant.model::radiant.model("https://github.com/radiant-rstats/docs/raw/gh-pages/examples/demo-dvd-rnd.state.rda", port = 8080) 
* Avoid empty string showing up in auto-generated code for model prediction (i.e., `pred_data` or `pred_cmd`) 
* Fix for VIF based on `car` for `regress` and `logistic`
* Load a state file on startup by providing a (relative) file path or a url. For example, radiant.model::radiant.model("https://github.com/radiant-rstats/docs/raw/gh-pages/examples/demo-dvd-rnd.state.rda") 
* Don't  live-update the active tree input to make it easier to save edits to a new tree without adding edits to the existing tree (Model > Decision analysis)
* Fix for NA error when last line of a decision analysis input is a node without a payoff or probability
* Load input (CMD + O) and Save input (CMD + S) keyboard shortcuts for decision analysis

# radiant.model 0.9.7.0

## Major changes

* Using [`shinyFiles`](https://github.com/thomasp85/shinyFiles) to provide convenient access to data located on a server

## Minor changes

* Fix for simulations that use a data set as part of the analysis
* Replace non-ASCII characters in example datasets
* Remove `rstudioapi` as a direct import

* Removed dependency on `methods` package

# radiant.model 0.9.5.0

## Major changes

* Various changes to the code to accomodate the use of `shiny::makeReactiveBinding`. The advantage is that the code generated for _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_ will no longer have to use `r_data` to store and access data. This means that code generated and used in the Radiant browser interface will be directly usable without the browser interface as well.
* Improved documentation and examples

* Updated user messages for _Model > Decision analysis_ when input has errors

# radiant.model 0.9.2.1

## Major changes

* The number of repetitions in Model > Simulate was NA when grid search was used
* Fix for large weights that may cause an integer overflow
* Minor fix for coefficient plot in `plot.logistic`
* Fixed state setting for decision analysis sensitivity input
* Fixed for special characters (e.g., curly quote) in input for Model > Decision Analysis
* Check that costs are not assigned to terminal nodes in Decision Analysis Trees.  Specifying a cost is only useful if it applies to multiple nodes in a branch. If the cost only applies to a terminal node adjust the payoff instead 
* Ensure : are followed by a space in the YAML input to Model > Decision Analysis
