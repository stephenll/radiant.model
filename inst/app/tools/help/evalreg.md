#### Response variable

The numeric outcome, or response, variable of interest.

#### Predictor

Select one or more variables that can be used to _predict_ the value of the response variable. This could be a variable or predicted values from a model (e.g., from a regression estimated using _Model > Linear regression (OLS)_ or a Neural Network estimated using _Model > Neural Network_).

#### Show results for

If a `filter` is active (e.g., set in the _Data > View_ tab) generate results for `All` data, `Training` data, `Test` data, or `Both` training and test data. If no filter is active calculations are applied to all data.

## Example

Predictions were derived from a linear regression and an neural network with two nodes in the hidden layer on the `diamonds` data. The variables `price` and `carat` were log-transformed prior to estimation.The data is available through the _Data > Manage_ tab (i.e., choose `Examples` from the `Load data of type` drop-down and press `Load`). The predictions shown below were generated in the _Predict_ tab.

The test statistics show a small, but consistent, advantage for the NN.

### Report > Rmd

Add code to <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/data/report.html" target="_blank">_Report > Rmd_</a> to (re)create the analysis by clicking the <i title="report results" class="fa fa-edit"></i> icon on the bottom left of your screen or by pressing `ALT-enter` on your keyboard. 

`Rsq`, `RSME`, and `MAE` are plotted by default. It is possible to customize the plotted results through _Report > Rmd_. To change the plot use, for example: 

```r
plot(result, vars = "Rsq")
```

The plot can be further customized using `ggplot2` commands (see example below)). See <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/data/visualize.html" target="_blank">_Data > Visualize_</a> for details.

```r
plot(result, vars = "Rsq") +
  labs(caption = "Based on data from ...")
```
